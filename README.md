A simple web app that reminds you to give your eyes a break

## Development

This project is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev)

### Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd 202020
npm install
```

...then start the app in development mode...

```bash
npm start
```

### Building for production

To create an optimized version of the app...

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build a static copy of the site to the `build/` folder, which can then be deployed.
